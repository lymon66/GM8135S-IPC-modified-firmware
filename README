Customized Firmware for cheap chinese ip-cameras with GM8135S chipset
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the GM8135S cameras usually come with firmware V4.02.R12.00017502.10010.042399.00000 
The problem with this firmware is that it does not have a web-interface or has any alternative way to 
update firmware or change settings, so it makes the camera quite useless.

I modified the firmware (based on fw-image: General_HZXM_IPC_GM8135S__50V10PL-S_V4.02.R12.Nat.OnvifS..20160407.bin) 
and made the following changes:

- telnet service on port 23 ( username: root ; password: xmhdipc )
- web-interface, so the camera can be fully configured and accessed.


to upload the modified files you need to connect via UART (usually located on the 3 blamk connection pins on top of the camera board)

once connected through UART and you can see the boot process, disrupt boot (camera ip will be 192.168.1.10)

start a tftp server on ip 192.168.1.107 and serve the xxx.cramfs.img files on a pc


> on the camera enter the following (at the uboot prompt):

# setenv appSystemLanguage English;setenv bootdelay 5;saveenv

> install modified firmware files:

# tftp 0x2000000 custom.cramfs.img;flwrite;tftp 0x2000000 user_web.cramfs.img;flwrite


> do not disconnect power to restart or reboot, as this may cause corruption or other unwanted problems.
> it's best to enter the following command after uploading the files and/or to reboot the camera:

# run bootcmd


> alternatively, if you need a semi full restore/recovery 
> important note : uboot (on partition mtd0) must still work !! otherwise camera will be dead and can not be recovered !

# tftp 0x2000000 custom.cramfs.img;flwrite;tftp 0x2000000 romfs-x.cramfs.img;flwrite
# tftp 0x2000000 user-web.cramfs.img;flwrite;tftp 0x2000000 web-x.cramfs.img;flwrite
# run bootcmd
